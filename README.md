# Radioactive
Archive of old game called Radioactive. Created in 2013, using Java & Greenfoot (http://www.greenfoot.org/home).

To run:

1. Download Greenfoot IDE (http://www.greenfoot.org/download).
2. Clone repository and run Greenfoot Project file.
3. Additionally, the game can be exported to a jar file from the Greenfoot IDE, so the Greenfoot IDE is no longer needed to play the game. If looking for only the executable jar file, which is 45MB (20MB over the limit for upload to GitHub), it is hosted here: http://tinyurl.com/radioactive-jar.
