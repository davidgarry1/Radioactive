# Radioactive
Archive of old game called Radioactive. Created in 2013, using Java & Greenfoot (http://www.greenfoot.org/home).

To run:

1. Download Greenfoot IDE (http://www.greenfoot.org/download).
2. Clone repository and run Greenfoot Project file.
3. Additionally, the game can be exported to a jar file from the Greenfoot IDE, so the Greenfoot IDE is no longer needed to play the game. If looking for only the executable jar file (45MB) it is hosted here: http://tinyurl.com/radioactive-jar. Being from 2013, the jar does not fit nicely on all current screen sizes/resolutions, so if you do not see a green play button on the bottom of your jar window, that means that it does not fit your screen size.
